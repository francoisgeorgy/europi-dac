## PCB versions

### [dac-board](dac-board) 

Do not use this version. The J2 and J3 connectors (headers that link the front panel) are incorrectly oriented.

### [dac-board-v2](dac-board-v2) 

This version is OK and has been successfully used with a regular EuroPi front-panel. 

### [dac-board-v2.1](dac-board-v2.1) 

This minor release fixes the connectors placement in KiCad. This version has not been tested yet.
